# Speech Recognition: Phoneme Classification 

## Executive Summary
A practical implementation of phoneme classification achieving 74% accuracy on real-world speech data. The system processes raw audio into mel-spectrograms, uses context-aware frame analysis, and employs a deep neural network architecture.

### Core Challenges
* Phonemes span multiple time segments
* Natural speech has uneven phoneme distribution
* Speaker variations and background noise
* Large-scale data processing requirements

### Technical Implementation

#### Audio Processing
Raw audio processing involves:
* 25ms frames with 10ms stride
* Fourier Transform conversion
* Mel-scale filtering for 40 features
* Context window of 85 frames (k=42)
* Input shape: `torch.Size([3400])`

#### Dataset Scale
* Training: 14,542 utterances (18.4M frames)
* Validation: 2,200 utterances (1.5M frames)
* Testing: 2,200 utterances (1.6M frames)

#### Memory Management
```markdown
Total dataset: ~251.77GB
Batch size: 1024 frames (~93MB)
```

Optimized DataLoader implementation includes:
* Multi-threaded loading
* GPU memory pinning
* Selective data shuffling

#### Neural Network Architecture
```python
Layer Structure:
Input (3400) → 1024 → 1024 → 512 → 256 → 128 → 64 → Output (71)
```

Each layer contains:
* Linear transformation
* BatchNorm
* ReLU activation

#### Performance Metrics
```markdown
Test Accuracy: 74.09%
Validation Accuracy: 73.70%
Training Accuracy: 42.53%
```

### Future Optimizations
* Reduce dropout rates
* Adjust batch normalization momentum
* Test alternative learning rate schedules
